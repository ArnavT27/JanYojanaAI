# JanYojana AI  
### Multilingual Grievance & Welfare Assistance Platform

JanYojana AI is an open-source, AI-powered platform designed to help Indian citizens navigate government grievance redressal systems and welfare schemes in a simple, multilingual, and guided manner.

The project focuses on reducing access barriers caused by language, procedural complexity, and fragmented public information.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Millions of Indian citizens are eligible for government welfare schemes or need grievance redressal but struggle due to:
- Complex and fragmented portals
- Language barriers
- Unclear complaint formats and processes
- Lack of proactive guidance on eligibility

This often leads to delayed benefits, rejected complaints, and dependence on intermediaries.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

JanYojana AI acts as an **intelligent assistance layer** over existing public systems. It helps users:

- Understand **where and how to file complaints**
- Generate **properly formatted complaint letters/applications**
- Discover **welfare schemes they are eligible for**
- Upload documents and extract key details using OCR
- Interact in their **preferred Indian language**
- Receive proactive scheme recommendations in the future

The platform does not replace government portals; it guides citizens to use them correctly.

## ⚙️ Core Features (Planned)

- Multilingual text-based interaction (voice support planned)
- Complaint classification and authority mapping
- Automated complaint letter / application generation
- Welfare scheme recommendation based on user profile
- Document OCR and data extraction (with user consent)
- Secure profile creation for future eligibility alerts
